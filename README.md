# Overview

Sometimes I find myself wanting to make a decision, but I don't actually want to be the one that makes the decision. That said, there are options that I like more than others so I want those to be more likely. With that in mind, I wanted to make a weighted randomizer.

I'd never worked in Kotlin before so I figured this would be a good opportunity to try it out.

# Development Environment

I didn't really use much of anything fancy in the base version of this project. All pretty much standard Kotlin.

The only external libraries that I did use was Java's file and input stream to read from a file.

# Future Work
* Use a GUI framework to make the program more user friendly
* Add additional error checking for reading in from a file
* [Make it object oriented](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html)
* Handle possibility of overflow errors
